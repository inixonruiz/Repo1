# Repo1 - Code from Devon
Nixon Ruiz Debug and Repo 1 - Improvement made using Firebase user authentication

In version 1.0 the App was using Firebase authentication.
In version 1.1, the App uses the FirebaseAuth instance to use the current user-session information.
In addition to that the App uses Dialog Box to display user information.
